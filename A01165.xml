            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The king ouertaking his vantgard, encamped at <hi>Foro Nouo,</hi> hard by the riuer of <hi>Terro.</hi> The marques was encamped on the other ſide, right in the way that the French men ſhould paſſe: ſo that the King ſeeing there was no remedie, but that he muſt needes fight,<note place="margin">The battell of Terro.</note> and open the way by the dint of the ſword, diſpoſed of his army in as warlike maner as he could, and reſolued as that day to try the vttermoſt of his fortune.

The Rerewarde was ledde by <hi>Foix,</hi> a Noble man of <hi>Guien,</hi> and <hi>Segnieur de Trimouille,</hi> and with them was there a great troupe of men at Armes.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2733:8"/> the Switzers and Almaines, in whom conſiſted the ſtrength of the battaile, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Ordinance, which being drawne with equall pace cloſe to the battail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon of the footmen, was placed right in the front of the enemie. The Mareſchall <hi>Guy,</hi> and <hi>Tribulzi</hi> a man of great fame and experience in the warres, marched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with certaine light horſemen, to lead the way to them which followed.</p>
               <p>The Marques ſeeing the French come downe from <hi>Foro Nouo,</hi> in aray of battaile,<note place="margin">The order of the Venetian armie.</note> quickly arraunged his men, and diuiding them into nine battaillons, as well for the mutuall ſuccour each of other, as thereby to aſſaile the French on all ſides, and intended to abide the comming of his enemies. In the firſt bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile was <hi>Petro Dodo,</hi> a Venetian, with ſixe hundred Greeke horſemen, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as many Archers on horſebacke, who were appointed to compaſſe the hils, and to aſſaile the enemie on the backe. The ſecond battaile was led by the earle <hi>Giazza,</hi> conſiſting of ſixe hundred men of Armes, and three thouſand Almaine and Italian footemen. The Generall himſelfe with his Vncle <hi>Radulph</hi> and <hi>Ranucio Farneſi,</hi> with fiue hundred men of Armes, and as many Archers, with foure thouſand footemen, tooke vpon him to encounter with the middle bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, wherein was the Kings owne perſon. The fourth battaile was aſsigned to <hi>Fortebraccio de Montoni,</hi> who was commaunded to charge the Rerewarde. Three other battailes were appoynted to <hi>Anthonie de Feltri, Annibal Bentiuoli,</hi> and <hi>Galeazzo Palauicini,</hi> which ſhould ſerue to ayde and ſuccour where there was moſt need. The eight and ninth battaile were likewiſe prouided againſt all vncertaine chances which might enſue.</p>
               <p>Each armie being thus readie raunged, awayted the ſignall of the battaile: which was no ſooner giuen,<note place="margin">The hardie encounter of both armies.</note> but they ranne togither with great furie, the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſounded, the drummes ſtroke vp, the great Ordinance thundered from either ſide, and all ſorts fought verie couragiouſly. But the <hi>Eſtradiots,</hi> who had beene repelled by the French men of armes, eſpying the Kings baggage (which by counſaile of <hi>Triuoltio</hi> had beene obiected to the enemie, to the ende that hee beeing buſie about the ſpoyle, a more readie and eaſie paſſage might bee opened for the King) flung out of their rankes, and fell to ryfling in moſt greedie manner. Which thing (in the opinion of all men) turned to the great good of the French: who otherwiſe had beene in maruaylous danger to haue beene ouerthrowne at that encounter. The Marques fought valiauntly, and pearcing through the middeſt of the horſemen hard to the Ordinance, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw a great bande of Gaſcons, which were appointed to guard them. The French being encouraged with the preſence of their king, laide about them like men, and the Switzers beeing promiſed double pay, like Tygres, tare and rent in peeces as manie as fell into theyr handes. And had not the earle of <hi>Petilia</hi> at that preſent eſcaped from the French, and by comming to the flying Italians, with all the forceable reaſons hee coulde, perſwaded them to renew the fight, the whole power of the Venetians had beene vtterly ouerthrowne. Both armyes being well wearied with a long and bloody fight,<note place="margin">The French K. looſeth all his baggage.</note> they ſounded the retreate. The French had loſt all their baggage, and the riches of <hi>Naples,</hi> which was going into Fraunce, was taken by the Italian ſouldiours: a great number of their braueſt men were ſlaine, and amongſt others the baſtarde of <hi>Burbon,</hi> a man of ſurpaſsing great valour. The King himſelfe hauing likewiſe loſt

And although he gate the victorie, and remained maiſter of the field, yet were his loſſes verie great, and farre ſurmounted the gaine he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in that long and wearie voyage.

               <p>The emperiall Captaines beeing driuen into great neceſſitie for want of money and other neceſſaries, and hauing much adoo to pacifie theyr ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours,<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials enuade the french Kings camp.</note> thought it beſt to vſe expedition, conſidering that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to continue long, their men growing mutinous for want of pay: and thereuppon as thoſe that ſtoode in very deſperate eſtate, haſted to inuade the French, who prepared with great courage to meete them: they were exceedingly encouraged by the preſence of theyr King, who ſhould bee an eye witneſſe of theyr valour and proweſſe.

               <p>All Europe was mightily diſmaied with the newes of this victorie, and all eſtates beganne to grow iealous of the Emperials greatneſſe.

This was no doubt a bitter receipt, and a ſharpe corroſiue to this magnanimous prince, who had not been vſed to be confined in ſo narrow a roume: but patience with hope was his beſt comfort, for the Emperour would not ſee him, much leſſe miniſter any matter of conſolation in that his wofull diſtreſſe, neither yet did he ſeeme to ſhewe any externall ſignes of ioy for ſo glorious a victorie:<note place="margin">The modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Charles the fift.</note> he prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited bonefires, ringing of belles, and ſuch like accuſtomed ſolemnities, ſaying that it might bee ſeemely to vſe outwarde reioycings for victories againſt the Turks, Sarrazins, and other infidels, but not againſt chriſtian Princes.</p>
               <p>The Emperours Councell were long before they could well tell what to do with this priſoner, they beeing diſtracted into diuers opinions: but in the ende it was fully concluded to make as great a gaine of him as might bee, and therefore they earneſtly preſſed him to yeeld ouer all his claime and title, to <hi>Burgondy, Millan,</hi> and <hi>Naples:</hi> beſides, hee was bound to pay a huge ſumme of money for his ranſome,<note place="margin">The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t betweene the Emperor and the french King.</note> and to condiſcend to ſundrie other things, and thoſe ſo great, that no man of iudgement thought hee would bee ſo good as his word. Yet for aſſurance the King was contented to marry the Lady <hi>Elynor</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ſiſter, and to grant that his two ſons, the Dolphin and the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> ſhuld be left in hoſtage for the better performance of the conditions.

               <p>The emperour beeing vexed at the heart with theſe newes, complained

All things beeing in a readineſſe, the emperials beganne to beate the Towne with their great Ordinance, in verie furious ſort, and in all hoſtile maner to annoy the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. The batterie continued long, and yet the harme was but ſmall, neither could the breach be made ſufficient for an aſſault. Whereupon they remoued the Canon to another part of the Citie.

               <p>This ſatisfied them for the time, and made them to temporiſe, &amp; expect their better fortune.

Who endeuouring to effect ſome notable exploit, laboured night and day, and made their approches without any empeachment, placing their batterie vpon a little mount, from whence they might annoy the defendants at their pleaſure. They had brought with them all warlike prouiſion, as powder, ſhot, and all ſorts of great and ſmall Ordinance, from ſundry townes and caſtels of <hi>Flanders.</hi> For this place was ſo odious vnto all that inhabited neare vnto it, that as ſoone as it was beſieged, not onely the women and little children, ranne thither to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſo gladſome a ſight, but in token of their ioies, they ſung ſongs, with daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and leaping, and brought into the campe, corne, beere, bread, ſheepe, and beeues, in great abundance.</p>
               <p>Their battery being once planted,<note place="margin">The furious batterie of Teroanne.</note> they began to beat the towne in ſuch furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſort, that the beſieged were exceedingly endaungered, no place being free from iminent perill.

And albeit the emperials were much endomaged herewith, yet were they ſo readily relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from other places, and all their wants ſo diligently ſupplied, that they eaſily amended as much in a day, as the French had marred in a week. So that wanting nothing that might either helpe themſelues, or hurt their enemies, they ceaſed neither day nor night, but thundring continually with the Canon, beat downe the walles, and ouethrew the Towers and Bulwarks, leauing nothing in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner vnder which the beſieged might ſhroud themſelues.<note place="margin">The courage of the beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> Howbeit they labored continually to repaire the breaches, and as men deſperate and careleſſe of their owne ſecuritie, they would be moſt buſie where the Canon was moſt furious, bringing earth, dung, fagots, and ſuch like neceſſarie matter for defence. Which continuall trauell did maruellouſly weaken the defendants, and by reaſon they were no great number, they were forced to be both ſouldiors and pioners, to watch in the night, and fight in the day, alwayes in action without ceaſing or intermiſsion.

               <p>When as the French King vnderſtood of this loſſe, he was wonderfully gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and fearing leaſt the emperor, (who was on the other ſide as ioifull for the good newes) would follow his fortune,<note place="margin">The French K. gathereth a great power to reſiſt the Emperor.

But the count <hi>Egmond</hi> vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the retreat of the French, ſuſpecting that they haſted to get out of his hands, croſſed the country by a nearer way, and put himſelfe between them and home, meeting them in the front not farre from <hi>Graueling.</hi> He was no ſooner in view of the enemy, but he cauſed the ſignall to be giuen,<note place="margin">Count Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth de Termes, and taketh him priſoner.</note> &amp; like a general of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsing courage, went reſolutely to the charge.

               <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> had likewiſe gathered a very ſtrong power, and al things were prouided by theſe two mightie Monarkes, as though they ment to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all their controuerſies by ſome one cruel &amp; bloody battell.

               <p>There was exceeding ſumptuous preparation againſt the appointed time: all the Nobilitie of <hi>France</hi> were aſſembled at <hi>Paris,</hi> to attend the king, &amp; to honor theſe eſpouſals.

The marriage being finiſhed, there was exceeding feaſting, banquetting, and cheering, with dauncing, maſking, and all other paſtimes that could be imagined, both to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the eye and pleaſe the eare.

Thus hadde theſe two gotten the ſole authoritie into their hands, and although the Queene mother was at the firſt the meanes to procure them ſo great place, and to make them ſo neere about the king, yet not long after ſhee repented her thereof, and ſought many waies to curb them, and to keepe them as ſhort as ſhee might: yet ſhee beeing a moſt vncertaine and inconſtant woman, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer inclining to the worſt, ſtill rather held with them, then with the princes of the bloud, who beganne to waxe wearie of the intollerable pride of the <hi>Guyſe,</hi> and the burning, murthering, and iniurious dealing of that bloudy houſe. The <hi>Guyſe</hi> no ſooner ſuſpected that their hearts were alienated, but that hee ſtudied day and night howe to ouerthrow them, and to cauſe the King to embrew his handes in the bloud of his owne kinred.

               <p>There were many ſupplications preſented vnto the Queene mother, to the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and others of greateſt place &amp; authoritie,<note place="margin">The Guyſe ſetteth the King againſt the princes of the bloud.</note> tending to the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of theſe miſeries, but they were little or nothing regarded: for the Queene mother fauoured not the Proteſtants in her heart, though often in the beginning made ſome ſhewe thereof, and gaue ſome helpe to the perſecuted Hugonots. The King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> was timorous, and would not proſecute the cauſe with ſuch a courage as hee ought to haue done: beſides, hee was beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the perſwaſions of regaining the kingdome of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> if hee would ſtill remaine a Catholike: which conceiued hope ſo ſtacke in his mind and made
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2733:25"/> ſo deepe an impreſſion in the bottome of his heart, that of a zealous and earneſt profeſſour, hee became key cold, and in the ende proued a bitter enemie to the cauſe: ſo that the Guyſes did ſtill what they liſted, and no redreſſe was to bee expected, for new Edicts &amp; proclamations were made, &amp; thoſe more ſeuere then before: ſuch as were knowne or ſuſpected to be Proteſtants, were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, &amp; either forced to recant, or elſe were burned. This barbarous vſage of ſo many natural Frenchmen, &amp; outragious crueltie towardes all ſorts, bred by little &amp; little a commiſeration in the hearts of ſundry, in whom there remained ſome ſparks of humanitie, ſo that banding together &amp; oppoſing themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the proceedings of that time, they endeuored by al poſſible meanes to reforme the common wealth, &amp; reduce the decaied eſtate to ſome better order: and albeit that ſundrie perſonages had ſhewed their liking of a reformation, as the K. of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the coneſtable, the Admirall, <hi>Dandelot,</hi> &amp; many others, yet no man attempted, but ſtrained courteſie (as it were) who ſhould begin: which procraſtinating ſundry of good place not beeing able to endure any longer, combined themſelues together, hauing for the principall and ringleader of their actions, one called <hi>Godfray de Berry,</hi> Lord of <hi>Renaudy,</hi>

               <p>This companie conſiſting of meere polliticks in the beginning, and ſuch as ſought for nothing but a reformation in the common weale, were in proceſſe of time aſſiſted by a multitude of thoſe who were tearmed Hugonots (as it is the maner of diſcontented perſons, how different ſo euer the occaſion be, to ioyne rogether in hope of fortunes accidents) who allied themſelues with the reſt, the more willingly, for that it was in a ciuill cauſe, and ſuch a thing as tended to the honour of the King, and generall good of the whole ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur de Renaudy</hi> hauing acquainted many of good account with this great and waightie enterpriſe, as the Baron <hi>Chaſtellnaw,</hi> Captaine <hi>Mazeres, Vaillay, Breſſay, Cheſnay, Chiray,</hi> S. <hi>Mary, Coqueuille, Chateaunef,</hi> and ſundrie others, reſolued with all poſſible ſpeed in as cloſe and ſecret maner as might be, to draw neere the Court, which was then at <hi>Amboyſe,</hi> and on the ſodaine with ſome fiue hundred Gentlemen,<note place="margin">The enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of the Lord of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naudy diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</note> to ſeiſe vpon the <hi>Guyſe</hi> and the Cardinall of <hi>Lorrain</hi> his Brother, and hauing once caught them to put them to death for an exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie puniſhment to all other ſeducers of the King, and diſturbers of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. This enterpriſe could not bee ſo cloſely kept but that it came to the eares of the Guyſes: who vnderſtanding after ſundrie examinations, the drift and ſcope of the whole proiect, and howe that moſt of thoſe who had complotted together, hadde long ſince ſhaken off the Popes yoake, deuiſed ſtraight to publiſh ſo notable a conſpiracie, and to make it ſeeme as odious as might bee to the eyes of all men: they declared howe that they of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion had conſpired againſt the king, the Queene mother, the kings brethren and Princes of the bloud, &amp; ſought to bring in their doctrine by force, to ouerthrow the monarchie of <hi>France,</hi> and to reduce it to a popular eſtate and gouernement, and by depriuing the king of his crowne, to pull downe the church, to root out the ancient Catholike faith, &amp; to infect the whole land with all kinde of impietie and irreligion, and hauing by ſundry proclamations
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2733:25"/> declared the hainouſneſſe of the fact, fearing that a matter of ſuch conſequence was not attempted without the priuitie of ſome great ones in the land: they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified themſelues very ſtrongly, muſtered ſouldiers, gathered forces, and gat all things in a readineſſe, to withſtand any attempt that ſhould be made vppon the ſodaine.</p>
               <p>Being thus prouided, they foorthwith apprehended ſuch as they ſuſpected, and proceeded againſt them with all rigour. Many of them who were taken were executed, and the reſt committed to ſeuerall priſons, ſauing ſome few that by their good fortune eſcaped their hands. At length diuers of the meaner ſort were ſet at libertie, fearing (indeede) that if all ſhould bee puniſhed, ſo great ſeueritie would alienate the hearts of many, who were nothing well affected alreadie. And although that the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall nor <hi>Dandelot</hi> could bee charged with the maintaining or abetting of anie of theſe attempts, yet did the Guyſes ſtrongly ſuſpect them, and eſpecially the three Chattillons,<note place="margin">The three Chattillons of all other moſt hated the Guyſes.</note> whom of all other they feared moſt: notwithſtanding, they thought it good pollicie to giue them faire ſpeeches for the time, and to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them in all plauſible maner, vntill they had gotten their forces about them, and had prouided a ſtrong armie in a readineſſe: which was no ſooner performed, but they began to ſpeake bigge words, and to deale more roughly: and firſt of all they dealt with the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who was commanded not to depart the Court without licence, while in the meane time they practiſed to catch matter againſt him, and to that purpoſe ſundrie with faire promiſes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes were ſubborned to proue him the cheefe of that ſeditious tumult at <hi>Amboyſe.</hi> They daily whiſpered in the Kings eare,<note place="margin">The Guyſes incenſe the King againſt the Prince of Conde.</note> that ſo long as <hi>Conde</hi> were at libertie, and ſuffered to countenance ſuch as alreadie were diſcontented with the preſent gouernement, the whole land would neuer bee at quiet, nor the kings perſon in ſafetie, as appeared by the laſt rebellious and tumultuous practiſe. The onely way to preuent ſo many and ſo great miſchiefes, was to bring the Prince to his anſwere, and by apprehending the ringleaders, to keep the meaner ſort in order and due obedience. Whereupon the king beeing by theſe ſiniſter informations mightily incenſed againſt the Prince, commaunded <hi>La Trouſſe,</hi> the ſteward of his houſe, to attach ſundrie of his ſeruants and to haue them in ſafe keeping, and to commaund the prince himſelfe to come vnto his preſence the next morrow: and to the ende there might be ſome matter found againſt him, his houſe was ſearched, and all his papers ranſacked: the Guyſes hadde alſo ſent to ſearch the Chamber and ſtudy of the king of <hi>Nauarres</hi> Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, hoping that ſomething would bee founde to miniſter matter againſt theſe great perſonages: for nowe they might do what they liſted, ſeeing the king approoued whatſoeuer they did, and did ſpeake as it were with theyr tongues.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as the Prince was informed of the kings pleaſure,<note place="margin">The Prince of Conde brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the king.</note> he readily obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and comming before him, did ſo cleare himſelfe, and anſwered with ſuch courage and alacritie, that it was thought good to diſmiſſe him for that preſent, without any further triall: whereupon the king ſhewed him very good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and the Guyſes ſeeing the time ſerued not to accompliſh what they had purpoſed, cloked all in as couert maner as might bee, and each departed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2733:26"/> from other as good friendes. But the Prince ſeeing his life was ſought for, thought it wiſedome to looke to himſelfe, and for that long ſince he fauoured the Goſpel, he ſuppoſed it to be beſt to go to his brother the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi>

               <p>To preuent the miſchiefes that might enſue hereof, the Queene mother with the reſt of the Kings councell, ſought by amiable letters and ſmoth words, to content ſuch as moſt complained, and where they did feare moſt danger, thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they ſend ſuch as were moſt gracious with the people, to keepe them in their obedience.

Many ſuch aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements were ſent from all quarters, and ſundrie euident ſignes appeared of ciuill warres. Whereupon it was thought good to aſſemble all the Princes of the bloud, the Nobilitie, the officers of the Crowne, and all men of place and authoritie, to deuiſe of the meanes how to pacifie theſe troubles, which were likely to enſue: which when the Guyſes vnderſtood, albeit they liked not to heare of the aſſemblie of the States,<note place="margin">The aſſembly of the States.</note> and therefore inwardly hated this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Admirall and the Chancellor, from whom it eſpecially proceeded, yet were they outwardly contented therewith, hoping by this meanes to draw the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the coneſtable and others to the Court, who otherwiſe could not ſo eaſily bee come by, and then to rule them well i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: aſſuring themſelues that the greateſt multitude of the Knights of the order, and others of the Nobilitie which ſhould bee there aſſembled, were at their deuotion, and therefore that nothing could paſſe in preiudice of them, but rather that all ſhould tende to theyr further profit and aduancement.

               <p>The Queene mother ſought to content <hi>Nauarre</hi> with faire wordes, but yet ſhe did not ſatisfie him as he deſired: and therefore the next day, hee with moſt of the Princes of the blood, the Coneſtable, his ſonnes and Nephewes of <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> departed from the Court towards <hi>Paris,</hi> highly diſcontented with the Queenes anſwere.

               <p>But leaſt <hi>Nauarre</hi> and his aſſociates ſhould bee too much diſcontented with this croſſe dealing, it was thought good to practiſe ſome newe attonement betweene them and the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> and to declare <hi>Nauarre</hi> the kings lieutenant ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall throughout all his dominions:<note place="margin">The King of Nauarre made lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant generall for the king.</note> which was accompliſhed by the meanes of the Coneſtable: ſo that now <hi>Nauarre</hi> was highly honoured, and the <hi>Guiſes</hi> made Court vnto him.

               <p>It was a wonder to heare what ioy there was generally, throughout the whole land, and how exceedingly the number of the Proteſtants were encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a ſhort tyme, by this little countenaunce which was giuen them.

               <p>Theſe and the like complaints much mooued the Queene mother, &amp; gladly ſhe would haue repreſſed theſe aſſemblies, if ſhee had knowne how.

               <p>While the Proteſtants were thus graced at their princes hands, and that all things ſeemed to go well with them, there fell out a ſtrange accident to croſſe that happie courſe of the Goſpel, and a moſt deuiliſh pollicie was vſed to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the reformed Religion, well neere eſtabliſhed in moſt of all the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Cities, and cheefeſt villages of the Realme: and that was this.</p>

               <p>Whereto the Prince anſwered, that hee for his part was very willing to leaue the Cittie, if the <hi>Guyſe</hi> would do the like: which thing beeing promiſed that it ſhuld be performed,<note n="*" place="margin">The prince of Conde lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Paris at the requeſt of the Pariſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the Guyſe ſeiſeth vpon it</note> the prince was no ſooner departed, but there were ſtrong guards ſette at the gates to keepe him from reentring: and ſo was the Prince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, and the <hi>Guyſe</hi> remained maiſter of the Citie: This beeing brought to paſſe, the <hi>Triumuirate</hi> preſently marched towards the Court,<note place="margin">The Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uirate ſeiſeth vpon the K.</note> and there tooke the king, the Queene mother, and the Kings brethren, whome they brought to <hi>Paris,</hi> and forthwith determined to proclaime wars againſt the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi>

There were letters written to the Emperour <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> and the Princes of the Empire, enforming them of the occaſion of their bearing of armes, and of the vſurped authoritie of the Guyſes and their adherents, earneſtly beſeeching them to haue ſome commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the King, who being a Child, was held in captiuitie by their tyranny, and al things likely to be brought to a woful deſolation throughout the realme of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince had no ſooner gathered a great power about him, &amp; was growne ſtrong by reaſon of a ſupply brought vnto him out of <hi>Poictou,</hi>

               <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and his aſſociats pondering in their minds the wofull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation that was like to enſue, if there were not ſome preſent remedy for theſe diabolicall proceedings, wrote diuers letters to the King, the Queene mother, and the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> beſeeching them to take ſome commiſeration vppon

               <p>Wherupon the prince tooke the field the nineteenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1562. with three Regiments of footmen, amounting to the number of 33.

               <p>This was no ſooner mooued by the Proteſtants, but it was accepted by the Queene mother, ſo that immediatly thoſe three principall Catholikes departed from the Court, and went as farre as <hi>Chaſteaudan,</hi> where they ſtayed to expect the ſequell of their ſecret councels. The Prince vnderſtanding of theyr depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, went preſently vnto the K. putting himſelf into the hands of the Queene mother, and other his enemies:<note place="margin">Conde put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe into the hands of his enemies.</note> but he was no ſooner come to the Court, but he forthwith repented of his haſte, and beeing aduertiſed by ſundry, of his immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perill and danger, pollitikely obtained of the Queen mother, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall men of his Armie might likewiſe come to knowe her further pleaſure: which beeing granted, hee wrote a ſecret letter vnto them of his eſtate,<note place="margin">A polliticke deuiſe of the Prince.</note> deſiring them to haſten, and to come ſtrongly accompanied.</p>
               <p>The next day early in the morning there came the Admirall, <hi>Dandelot, Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faucont,</hi> the Prince <hi>Portian, Rohan, Genlis, Gramont, Soubize, Piennes,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lords &amp; Captains, with a far greater retinew then the Queen expected: ſo that nowe ſhe thought it beſt to make fayre weather, and to ſooth them vp, conſidering (in deed) that ſhee was not able to detayne the Prince any longer then hee himſelfe liſted, and therefore in very gracious maner ſhee bad them al welcome, and openly in the preſence of all the Nobilitie, ſhee gaue them great thanks, for their true and faithfull ſeruice towardes the king, aſſuring them
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2733:32"/> that ſhee (for her parte) did thinke very honourably of all their proceedings, and did not doubt but the King her ſonne would bee mindfull hereafter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence ſo many deſerts,<note place="margin">The Queene mother al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth of the proceedings of the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> ſeeing it was very apparant that both his eſtate and her owne was maintained by their royall ſeruices.

               <p>They further declared vnto the Queen mother, the manifold greeuances of the kings ſubiects, with a meanes to remedie ſo many &amp; ſo lamentable diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to al which &amp; ſundry other remonſtrances, albeit ſhe ſeemed to giue ſome allowances, yet for that ſhee ſtood ſo ſtiffly againſt the free exerciſe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and would needes vrge the Prince to depart the Realme (as indeed he had promiſed, rather then hee would bee any occaſion of the continuance of ciuill wars, albeit preſently vppon better and more mature conſideration hee repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him of the ſpeech) there could bee nothing concluded. Whereupon the Prince returned to his campe,<note place="margin">The Prince of Conde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to his Campe &amp; prepareth for warre.</note> exceeding glad that God had deliuered him out of the ſnares of his enemies, and reſolued with all, for his forces to fight it out, and to hazard his fortune aſſoone as any oportunitie was offered.

               <p>The Prince ſeeing hee could not drawe them out of their ſtrength, hauing braued them in the faces, and maintained ſome light skirmiſhes with them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired towardes <hi>Orleance,</hi> ſending abroad into all quarters to prouide all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for the warres: and for the more ſpeedy accompliſhment heereof, it was decreed that <hi>Soubize</hi> ſhoulde bee ſent to <hi>Lyons, Rochfaucont</hi> into <hi>Xaintoigne, Duras</hi> into <hi>Guyen,</hi> and <hi>Briquemault</hi> into <hi>Normandy,</hi> and ſo into <hi>England,</hi> to procure both men and money, and as many friendes as might be gotten. <hi>Dande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot</hi> was likewiſe ſent into <hi>Germany,</hi> to haſten ſuch ſuccours as were promiſed by the Princes Proteſtants. <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Admirall, with the reſt of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and Gentlemen, with two and twenty enſignes of footmen remained ſtil in <hi>Orleance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this time were the forces which came out of <hi>Germany</hi> to the aide of the Catholikes in a readineſſe to march vnder their Collonelles,<note place="margin">Forces ſent out of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many to aide the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes.</note> 
                  <hi>Rokendolf, Frewlich,</hi> and the <hi>Ringraue,</hi> who beſides certaine Cornets of Reiſters, had likewiſe twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie enſignes of Lanſquenits.

               <p>The Catholikes were long in ſuſpence whether they ſhould beſiege <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance,</hi> or <hi>Rohan,</hi>

               <p>The loſſe of this Citie being a place of ſo great importance, was a maruailous diſcouragement vnto many, who ſtood but faintly to their tacklings before, and had (no doubt) wrought a more daungerous effect, had not this breach beene repayred, or at leaſt well amended, by the ſurpaſsing care and prouident cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectneſſe of <hi>Dandelot,</hi> who ſo plied his friends in <hi>Germany,</hi>

               <p>The Prince after ſome ſmal ſtay to repoſe his wearied troups, marched on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Paris,</hi>

But ſuch was their timorouſneſſe, that they kept themſelues cloſe, albeit the battell was preſented vnto them twiſe at the leaſt, and onelie amuſed the Prince with certaine conditions of peace, about the which there were manie meetings. In the end all being found to be but meere delayes, and onelie to gaine time, vntill the comming of the Spaniardes, the Prince reſolued to aſſaile the enemie in his Trenches: but the ſame night, which was appoynted for this exployte, and immediately before it ſhoulde haue beene put in execution, <hi>Genlis</hi> a principall man among the Proteſtants, ſecretely fledde to the Catholikes: which vnexpected accident quite altered the councell of the Confederates, ſuppoſing that now there was ſome aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement giuen of their intended enterpriſe:<note place="margin">Genlis flieth to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes</note> and therefore they deferred the execution of that proiect, vntill ſome other tyme.

               <p>The Catholikes coaſted him all the way watching to catch him at ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage: howbeit nothing was attempted vntill both the camps were come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Dreux,</hi> where they approched ſo neare, and either partie had ſo farre engaged themſelues, that there was no remedie, but they muſt needes fight: ſo that now each Generall began to bethinke of all good meanes for the ſtrengthening of himſelfe, and the weakening of his enemyes. The Catholikes had made choyſe of a verie ſtrong place to encampe in, beeing neare vnto <hi>Dreux,</hi>

Each battaillon was flanked with certaine troupes of horſe, as it were for a mutuall ſuccour one for another, with their <hi>Enfans perdus</hi> in their fronts, and thoſe of the choyſeſt of all their regiments.

               <p>The Mareſchall S. <hi>Andrew</hi> led the auauntgard,<note place="margin">The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like armie.</note> which was compoſed of nine companies of French launces, thirteene enſignes of Spaniards, with as manie French, and eleuen of Almaines, with foure field peeces: all which were aran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the left ſide of the Coneſtable, who led the maine battaile, further aduaunced then eyther the Mareſchall, or the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> wherein were ſeuenteene Cornets of men of Armes, and three of light horſmen, with two and twentie enſignes of Zwitzers, ſeuenteene of French and Britons, and eyght peeces of great Ordinance. The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> led the rerewarde, which ſeemed to flanke the battaile of the Coneſtable on the right ſide, with a ſtrong troupe of horſemen, and two eſquadrons of Spaniſh footemen, with ſundrie others his followers, men of eſpeciall account, and much renowmed for their valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antneſſe.</p>
               <p>The prince had ſo araunged his battailes, that the horſemen wherein they ouermatched his enemies, were in the formoſt rankes,<note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants armie</note> and taking vnto himſelfe <hi>Rochfaucont,</hi> with certaine light horſemen of <hi>Guries</hi> companie, with ſome other Cornets led by <hi>Mouy,</hi> and <hi>Auarell,</hi> beſides a troupe of Reiſters, all which ſerued as flankers for his battailon of footmen, reſolued to encounter the Coneſtable, who ſeemed to be readie to giue the charge.</p>
               <p>Each generall hauing diſpoſed of all things in this warlike ſort, the great artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie began to vomit out their deuilrie, and the Coneſtable prepared to aſſaile the battaile of the Prince, which haſted in like maner to the encounter, and that with ſo ſtately and ſuperbious a diſmarch, that it gaue euident teſtimonie, that it was led by a generall of noble courage, and great experience. The Prince charged the Zwitzers, who valiantly endured the firſt ſhotte, and ſtoode to it verie manfully.<note place="margin">The Prince of Conde charge the Switzers, &amp; ouerthroweth them.</note> But at length by reaſon of the ſmal ſhot which hailed vpon them without ceaſing, and ſomwhat cleared their ranks, they began to giue ground, which the valiant and couragious <hi>Mouy</hi> eſpying, incorporating his troups with <hi>Monſieur de Daneret,</hi> ſet on them with ſuch furie, that he made them flie amaine.

               <p>The newes of this battaile was verie vncertaine: each ſide ſuppoſing, yea, and conſtantly reporting their owne ouerthrowe. But vpon more certaine intelligence, how that both Generals were taken, and that they had parted in a maner with equall loſſe, each faction beganne to rowſe vp themſelues, and to hope for better ſucceſſe in their future wars: wherupon they reſolued to chooſe them new Generals, vntill the old were againe reſtored to libertie. The duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was thought the meeteſt to commaund ouer the Catholikes,<note place="margin">The D. of Guiſe choſen generall ouer the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks, and the Admirall ouer the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</note> and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall ouer the confederates, who pondering their harmes lately receiued by the death of ſo many braue men, and their want of many neceſſaries requiſit for to keepe the field, thought it beſt to retire, the one to <hi>Paris,</hi> the other to <hi>Orleance,</hi> and there to repaire their broken armies.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> lay not long idle, but aſſayed to recouer certaine townes from the Confederates, as <hi>Pluuiers, Estamps,</hi> and ſome others. The Admirall on the other ſide, beeing as carefull to maintaine heade agaynſt the enemie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged <hi>Selles</hi> in <hi>Berry,</hi> which was yeelded vpon compoſition: where he found good ſtore of gold and ſiluer for the payment of his Reiſters. <hi>Rochfaucont</hi> tooke S. <hi>Agnan:</hi> and the Prince <hi>Portian,</hi> entered <hi>Monrichard.</hi> The gayning of which Townes greatly countenanced the wauering eſtate of the Proteſtants. Thus did theſe two armyes flote vp and downe, each ſeeking to encroach vppon other ſo much as might bee. At length the Admirall eſpying the drift
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2733:34"/> of the <hi>Guiſe,</hi> which was to inueſt <hi>Orleance</hi> on the ſudden, put himſelf with all his forces within the Citie.

               <p>The Queene mother being aduertiſed hereof, laboured to ſtop his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded voyage, by propounding a parle of peace: but the Admirall being well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſuch ſtratagems, would in no wiſe hearken thereto, but folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed his formed proiect, and ſo with ſome 3000. horſe paſsingly well furniſhed, and far better then at the battel of <hi>Dreux,</hi> held on his courſe. And being a man of great experience, and ſingular expedition in all his enterpriſes, he ſurpriſed on the ſudden ſundry places, which proued afterward of no ſmall moment, for the aduancing of the affaires of the confederates.</p>
               <p>The duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> hauing his armie in a readineſſe, and vnderſtanding of the Admirals departure from <hi>Orleance,</hi> leauing <hi>Dandelot</hi> his brother for the guarde therof, vntill his returne, thought it beſt to beſiege them who were there aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, while the Admirall with the flower of all their troupes was buſied other wheres.

Yea, the Duke ſo aſſured himſelfe thereof, that hee wrote to the King and Queene Mother, that he hoped now to extirpe the race of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> who had for ſo many yeares troubled the whole land, and that he would ſend them newes therof within foure and twentie houres. But while he was thus in his ruffe, firmely perſwading himſelfe that all was his, bebold, there fell out a ſtraunge and vnexpected accident, which brake the necke of all his deuiſes.</p>
               <p>There was a poore Gentleman named <hi>Iohn Poltrot,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The ſtorie of Poltot that killed the Duke of Guiſe.</note> one of verie little ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but full of ſpirite and lyfe, and generally reputed of ſuch as beſt knewe him, to bee ſomewhat a raſh headed fellow, and verie vndiſcreete, and one that durſt attempt any thing. Who being brought vp for a long time in <hi>Spaine,</hi> had learned the language verie perfectly: And for that both for his colour, complection, and ſtature, he was ſo like vnto them of that nation, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the little Spaniard.</p>
               <p>This fellow ſeruing ſometime vnder <hi>Soubize,</hi> who commaunded at <hi>Lyons,</hi> woulde often vaunt, that this was the hande (ſtretching out his arme) that ſhoulde kill the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and deliuer <hi>Fraunce</hi> from that monſtrous and cruell Tyrant. And this hee vſually vttered in great brauerie: ſo that as manie as heard him, knowing the humour of the man, laughed at his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, little imagining that hee meant as hee ſayde, for if hee had, then it was lykely hee woulde haue kept his purpoſe more ſecrete, and not haue beene ſo open mouthed. It happened ſo, that immediately after the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile of <hi>Dreux, Soubize</hi> ſent this <hi>Poltrot</hi> with a Letter to the Admirall, who was nowe at <hi>Selles</hi> in <hi>Berrie:</hi> whither hee was no ſooner come, but that <hi>Feuquieres,</hi> whome hee had ſerued in former tymes in the warres in <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardie,</hi> knowing him to bee a man of ſeruice, commended him to the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2733:35"/> Admirall, ſaying: that he was a fit man to bee employed to diſcouer ſomewhat of the enemyes proceedings about <hi>Orlean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi> for that he ſhoulde bee taken for a Spaniard, and ſo a fauourer of theyr deſignes. Wherupon the Admirall gaue him twentie Crownes, and ſent him to <hi>Orleance:</hi> where hee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued not long, but hauing got as good intelligence as he coulde, returned backe to do his meſſage.</p>
               <p>The Admyrall lyking the man well for his diligence, and ſecrecie in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſuch importaunce, gaue him an hundred Crownes, and bidde him buy him a good Horſe, that hee might with more celeritie diſpatch his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. With this money <hi>Poltrot</hi> bought him a verie excellent Spaniſh Genet, and leauing the Admirall, went backe to the <hi>Guiſes</hi> Campe, where he away<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome oportunitie to put in execution his intended purpoſe. Which ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after fell out: for hee eſpying the Duke ſomewhat late in the euening ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding towardes his Tent vppon a little Nagge, onely attended on by a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman Vſher which went before him, and an other which talked with him: hee approched as neare as hee could, and diſcharged his piſtoll vpon the Duke, hitting him in the ſhoulder, wounded him verie ſore, and ſo turning his horſe, fled as faſt as he could. And hauing ridden all that night by by-wayes, for feare of thoſe who purſued him, he not knowing which way he went, wandred vp and downe, &amp; in the end came againe almoſt to the place where hee committed the fact. Which when he perceiued, he rode all the day folowing, with as much ſpeed as poſsibly might be, to get out of the danger of his purſuing enemies. But hauing with continuall trauell wearied both himſelfe and his horſe, he reſted at a farm houſe, where he was taken vpon ſuſpition, and committed to ſafe keeping for his further triall. Being examined, and found culpable, he was adiudged to be drawn in peeces with foure horſes:<note place="margin">Poltrot drawne in peeces with horſes.</note> to haue his head cut off, and his torne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to be burnt to aſhes.</p>
               <p>This ſudden blow did maruellouſly diſmay the Catholikes, and the rather for that it appeared to be deadly, and not poſsible to be healed: For he waxed worſe euerie day then other, and died very ſhortly after,<note place="margin">The Duke of Guiſe died within ſeuen or eight daies after his hurt</note> to their vnſpeakable greefe: who had repoſed their whole confidence in him, and to the great reioycing of the confederates, whoſe deadly &amp; ſworne enemies he was alwayes accounted. And this was the end of that turbulent ſpirit, &amp; ambitious <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who as he had maſſacred many: ſo he in the end was murthered by others, and that euen then when he thought leaſt of any danger: nay rather fully perſwaded himſelfe well neare to haue attained to the full period of his wiſhed deſires. So vncertaine is the ſtate and condition of the greateſt, and moſt mightie perſonages in this vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and changeable world.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Guiſe</hi> was no ſooner dead, but there enſued a preſent alteration: and thoſe conditions which had beene before propounded, were forthwith fully agreed vpon, &amp; ſo was there a peace proclaimed the 19. of March folowing at S. <hi>Memen,</hi> in the campe before <hi>Orleance,</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow was <hi>France</hi> once againe reduced to a quiet eſtate, and who would not haue thought, but that after ſo many baſtonados,<note place="margin">The third ciuill warres.</note> euery one would haue bin glad to haue nouriſhed the ſame by all poſsible meanes, and to haue learned by their former miſeries to beware, how they entred into new troubles. But ſuch were the wicked counſels of ſome turbulent ſpirits, that they could not endure any quietnes, but gaue daily occaſions to fill the whole land full of new broyles and vprores. The two late reconciled factions were continually very iealous each of others proceedings, one blamed the other for not accompliſhing ſuch conditions as were agreed vpon, and ſo ſolemnly ſworne on both ſides. The Catholiks alledged that the Proteſtants had not put all their ſtrong townes into the kings hands, according to the tenure of the Articles of the peace lately agreed vpon: that <hi>Rochell</hi> did fortifie it ſelfe, and would not receyue the Catholikes into their former offices and dignities:<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Catholiks.</note> that they rigged ſhippes, and made themſelues ſtrong at ſea, and that without the kings knowledge: that <hi>Coqueuille</hi> leuied many ſoldiers for the ayd of the prince of <hi>Orenge,</hi> contrarie to the pacification made before <hi>Chartres.</hi> All which things could not be atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted without the knowledge of the confederats: &amp; that which was moſt ſtrange of al, they practiſed to leuy ſoldiers in <hi>Germany,</hi> &amp; other places.</p>
               <p>The Proteſtants complained,<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Proteſtants.</note> that they could not be permitted freely to vſe their conſciences, according as it was conditioned. That the Catholikes did ſtill retaine the Switzers, and the Italian bands, and placed ſundry ſtrong garriſons in thoſe townes which were of the Religion, and that ſuch which had liued in exile, could not returne to their houſes without imminent peril of their liues. Alledging withall, the horrible murthers, robberies, and other execrable facts, committed vpon the perſons, and goods of thoſe of the reformed Churches. Theſe with ſome others were the reaſons which animated both parts to ſtirre coales, and to begin the warres afreſh.</p>
               <p>The Catholikes knowing <hi>Rochell</hi> to be a verie ſtrong place, ſought by al cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning deuiſes to make themſelues maiſters thereof, and with fayre promiſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled with threats, laboured to perſwade them to receyue a garriſon of the Catholikes, but they would in no caſe agree thereto, but ſtill droue them of with newe delayes. <hi>Tauannes</hi> was commaunded to ſurpriſe the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi>

The reſt of the Proteſtant Captaines, as <hi>Dandelot, Mountgommery, La Noue,</hi> and others, being aduertiſed of all theſe ſturres, gathered what forces they could, and marched towards <hi>Rochell,</hi> with great ſpeede, taking by the way, <hi>Partenay, Niort,</hi> and <hi>Maile,</hi> which proued afterwarde very aduantagious for the Confederates. <hi>Angoleſme, Pons, S.

                  <note place="margin">The battell of Baſſac.</note>The Admirall being appointed to impeach the making of theſe new bridges conſidering he was not able to effect that which he deſired, retired vnto <hi>Baſſac,</hi> ordayning <hi>Soubize, Puuiant,</hi> and other troupes of <hi>Poictou,</hi> to fauour his retreate. The Prince (all things being well conſidered) was not willing to reſolue of a battaile, and therefore willed the Admirall to diſlodge with the auaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, and to bee with him at <hi>Farnac</hi> the next morning by the breake of the day. Which in no wiſe could be performed by all: for the companies ledde by <hi>Puuiant,</hi> could not march ſo ſpeedily, the Catholikes being at their taile, and ſo ſtrongly preſſed them, that they could not bee diſgaged, but with the hazarde and perill of all the Proteſtants. For the footemen of his excellencie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing paſſed a Riuer, doubled their pace to gaine a little hill, which was
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2733:40"/> a place of ſome aduauntage: from which they diſcouering how ſmall a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the Admirall had, aduaunced ſtill forward, knowing that he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, without the intire loſſe of all his troupes. By this time <hi>Puuiant</hi> was ſo farre engaged, that had not <hi>La Noue,</hi> and <hi>La Loue,</hi> who made the retreate of the Auauntgarde with fortie Harquebuziers, ſpeedilie come to his ſuccours, hee had remayned at the mercie of his enemies. But when as they had with all theyr deuoir ſuccored them in their need, they were forthwith compelled to defend themſelues vpon the bay of a pond, where they were ſo luſtily charged by <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues, Malicorne,</hi> and others to the number of fiue of ſixe hundred horſe, that <hi>La Noue,</hi> and <hi>La Loue</hi> were taken priſoners,<note place="margin">La Noue &amp; La Loue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> and all their bands intirely broken, and defeated. <hi>Puuiant</hi> hauing charged, and finding himſelfe too weake, retired to the reſt of the footmen. During theſe hot skirmiſhes, ſundry of the Catholikes were aduanced forwards, wherof ſome two hundred came hard to the village: who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when the Admirall and <hi>Dandelot</hi> diſcouered, beeing ignorant of the ouerthrow aforeſayde, for that the village hindered theyr ſight, they reſolutely charged: and <hi>Dandelot</hi> being formoſt with his cornet, gaue in ſo furiouſly, that he made them all to run amaine,<note place="margin">Dandelot ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques to runne.</note> leauing behind them <hi>Monſales,</hi> and thirteen others dead vpon the place. <hi>Dandelot</hi> purſued them hard to the village, from whence he was no ſooner returned, but thoſe Catholikes being backed with 1200. harquebuzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, reentred more ſtrongly accompanied then before. Whileſt things paſſed on after this maner, al the reſt of the troups of the Catholikes began to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, euery regiment taking his place for the laſt encounter.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> beeing aduertiſed of all this, and of the daunger that the Admirall with all the Auauntgard was in, if they were not ſpeedily ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured, aduaunced himſelfe with thoſe few horſemen of his battaile, which he tumultuouſly aſſembled in that vprore, the reſt beeing diſperſed into ſeuerall quarters here and there, haſted to the reſcue with all the ſpeede that might bee. Each Generall began nowe to ſeeke his aduauntage, and to prepare himſelfe to the fight. The Admirall eſpying that <hi>Monſieur</hi> came faſt on vpon the left hand, which was the meanes to encloſe the Proteſtants betweene the riuer, and the armie of the Catholikes, commaunded <hi>La Touer</hi> to bring the companies of the Auantgard further forwards: which he did, and bare himſelfe ſo, that his horſe being ouerthrowne, he was taken, and beeing knowne to be the man that had ſlaine captaine <hi>Carry</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> was killed forthwith,<note place="margin">La Touer ſlaine.</note> beſides many others, who had no better fortune.</p>
               <p>The army Catholike ſtill ſtretched it ſelfe forth vpon the left hande, towards the troupes of <hi>Soubize, Languillier, Puuiant, Creſſomere,</hi> and the reſt of the Chieftaines of <hi>Poictou:</hi> who thinking it not conuenient to expect anie oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for a better charge, ſeeing the enemie reenforce himſelfe more and more, aſſayled the formoſt Troupes with ſuch furie, that they made them recule: but by reaſon of newe ſupplyes which were ſent continuallie, <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bize,</hi> and <hi>Languillier</hi> were taken priſoners,<note place="margin">Soubiz, and many other taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> 
                  <hi>Meſauchere, Brandamere,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie others were then ſlaine. In the meane time his excellencie deſirous to breake them on all ſides, brought a great part of his armie an other way, purpoſing to encloſe them, who kept the bay of the ponde, and to aſſayle them on the backe. But this pretence being eſpied, the confederates, who had
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2733:41"/> maintained the aduantage of the ground a good while, thought it beſt to retyre into a place of greater ſafetie. Whileſt the fight was thus hotely continued on either ſide, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> with three or foure hundred horſe, gaue a hote charge vpon the Catholiques: and being chaufed to ſee his men in rout, and the whole army to bear it ſelf no better, flang in with ſuch fury, that he bare to the ground, or made to run all that were before him, vntill ſuch time as his horſe beeing wounded, hee was ouerthrowne, and not able any longer to doo any thing for the blowes hee had receyued: and becauſe hee was not ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a freſh horſe in tyme, ſeeing his enemies to preſſe ſore vppon him, hee yeelded vnto <hi>Argence,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iean,</hi> who promiſed to ſaue his life: but <hi>Monteſquion</hi> (as ſome ſay) paſsing by at that inſtant, ſhot him into the head with a piſtoll, whereof he died forthwith.<note place="margin">The prince of Conde ſlaine.</note>

The King taking with him the Queene mother,<note place="margin">The king go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to viſit the Admiral</note> his two brethren, and moſt of the principall Catholikes went likewiſe to comfort him, ſhewing many ſignes of great ſorrow for his harme, complaining that indeede the Admirall felt the harme, but the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was done to the King, vpon whoſe faithfull promiſe hee was come to the Court, and therefore both hee that had committed the fact, and all that conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereto ſhould bee moſt ſeuerely puniſhed, to the example of all other vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous and notorious malefactors: whereto the Admirall anſwered, that hee would leaue the reuenge to God, and the execution of Iuſtice to the King, but as for the authour hee was knowne well inough, and becauſe hee could not tell how long hee had to liue, hee beſought the king that hee might talke with him in ſecret, touching things of very great importance, and ſuch as were moſt neceſſarie for the ſtate of the Kingdome. The King ſeemed to bee willing herewith, but the Queen mother by a deuiſe brake off their talke for that time, ſo that there was no further conference: and becauſe the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and diuers others, moued the king that they might haue leaue to carrie the Admiral to his houſe at <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> which was ſome two daies iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>Paris,</hi> as to a place of greater quiet and ſecuritie: the king not willing to condiſcend thereunto, anſwered, that ſo long a iourney would very much endanger his health: and therefore he thought it better to haue him lodged in the <hi>Louure</hi> neere vnto his owne perſon, where he ſhould be ſafe from all perill: furthermore he willed all the cheefe of the Proteſtant Nobilitie, to place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as neere him as they could, in caſe that if there were any need they might be readie to ſuccour one another, and appointed the Mareſchall <hi>Coſſy</hi> with a band of harquebuziers to guard his lodging.<note place="margin">The wolfe appointed to keepe the Lambe.</note> Vpon the Satterday, which was the twenty three of Auguſt, the councell ſat about the examination of certaine witneſſes touching the fact, and ſundrie other ſuſpected perſons, taking great paines (as it ſeemed) to boult out the truth, as though they meant to puniſh the offender with all rigour and ſeueritie. With theſe and the like apparances, the proteſtants helde themſelues well ſatiſfied, neuer ſuſpecting that all was but diſſimulation and that ſo great miſchiefe did hang ouer their heads.</p>
               <p>The ſame day there was a ſodaine rumour ouer al the Citie, that the king had ſent for the Mareſchall <hi>Memorancy,</hi> commanding him to come to him with al the forces hee could make, and therefore the Pariſians were beſt to ſtande vppon their guard: but all was founde in the end to be vtterly falſe. <hi>Teligny</hi> beeing gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to vnderſtand by the Admirals trumpetters that there were ſixe cart loades
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2733:48"/> of Armour brought into the <hi>Louure,</hi> anſwered that hee did not like that men ſhould bee ſo ſuſpitious without cauſe: for his part hee was well aſſured of the Kings good fauour, and wiſhed other men were ſo likewiſe, ſeeing it was not poſſible that there ſhould be any harme intended towardes them whome the king had honoured ſo many waies. and had oftentimes ſo ſolemnely ſworne to remaine theyr gracious and louing ſoueraigne.</p>
               <p>But the king with all thoſe of his ſecret counſell, ſeeing that they had nowe brought all things about euen as they had deſired, and that the Admirall was taken in a trap and all his principall aſſociats, ſo ſnarled in their nets that it was impoſſible for them to get out, thought it high time to putte in execution that which they had purpoſed ſo long before, and at that inſtant to finiſh the dayes of all the Proteſtants. Whereuppon a ſignall was giuen in the dead of the night by the touling of a Bell in the <hi>Louure:</hi> which was no ſooner heard by <hi>Coſſy,</hi> who (as is alreadie ſayde) with a bande of harquebuziers guarded the Admiralles lodging, but that hee commaunded his men to breake open the doores, and to kill as many as they ſounde in their wayes. The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall hearing the noyſe and fearing ſome ſeditious enterpriſe, willed one of his Gentlemen to call to the guard which was appointed him by the King, little imagining that it was they that came to offer him ſuch violence, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing out of his bedde, putte on his night gowne, and kneeled downe to pray.</p>
               <p>By this time were ſundrie of the murtherers gotten in, &amp; had ſlaine ſuch as they found in the houſe.

The Canon was no ſooner placed, but that it forthwith played vpon the Towne very furiouſly, and to the great terrour of ſuch as had not beene acquainted with the like ſport. Thoſe of <hi>Rochel</hi> were not idle, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided all neceſſaries to ſtop ſuch breaches as ſhould be made, and anſwering the Catholikes with ſuch ſhot as they had, often iſſuing out, and skirmiſhing with their enemies with notable courage and alacritie.

But they within ſo nobly &amp; valiantly defended themſelues, and ſo politikely preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted all their ſtratagems, that they could not by any means accompliſh their deſires. Yea, they ſeemed ſo little to regard all their endeuors, that vpon May day, in great ioylitie and triumph, they decked their walles, and towers: and with trumpets, drums, flu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The King was brought into ſuch a ſecuritie of his eſtate by this wicked Councell, that he did not onely reiect ſuch aduertiſements as were ſent to him from time to time, both from the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> Duke <hi>Caſſimer,</hi> and other Princes, touching the monſtrous conſpiration of the Leaguers: but alſo as one that knew not what hee did, hee made great preparation againſt them of the reformed Religion, and ſuffered the Leaguers in the meane time to grow and fortifie themſelues at their owne pleaſures, vntill they were become ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they thought themſelues able inough, if neede were, to go through with theyr intended courſe, whoſoeuer ſhoulde ſay nay.

               <p>The Duke <hi>de Maine</hi> did all this while what hee could to any the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and to gayne as many Citties and townes (through very ſecrecie) as hee could to ioyne with the League, and to make that faction ſtrong againſt the King, by ſeducing his ſubiects vnder the colour of maintaining the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Religion.

               <p>Now as the Leaguers laboured openly by theſe and ſuch like deuiſes, to weaken the King, ſo they practiſed ſecretly to deſtroy the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> knowing that if they were once ridde of them, it woulde bee an eaſie matter to accompliſh the reſt.

               <p>The <hi>Guiſes</hi> and the reſt of the leaguers, reioyſed not a little at this newes: for nowe they thought they were gotten one ſteppe higher, and had greater hope to oppreſſe the Proteſtants then before: who they knewe were migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily weakened with this loſſe. And for that they ſuppoſed that in this conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of mens mindes, they had oportunitie to attempt ſomething, which might ſtill aduaunce their affaires, they thought good that the Lorde <hi>Lauerdin,</hi> who had ſcaped a ſcowring at the battaile of <hi>Coutras,</hi> ſhould aſſaile <hi>Marans,</hi> a place of very great importaunce, and if it were poſsible to make it ſure for the league.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Lauerdin</hi> applied his buſineſſe ſo diligently, that he gayned the ſayd Iſland of <hi>Marans</hi> in a ſhort time,<note place="margin">Marans gained by the Lord Lauer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</note> by reaſon that the Proteſtants, being amaſed (as it were) with the vnexpected death of the Prince, did not prouide timelie enough for the fortifying thereof, with ſuch ſtore of men and munition, as was neceſſarie.</p>
               <p>Albeit that the King was glad, that the Lord <hi>Lauerdin</hi> had gotten <hi>Marans,</hi> yet he liked not that it ſhould be kept by the Lord <hi>Cluſeaux,</hi> whom he knewe to bee a fauourer of the League: but there was no remedie, he muſt beare with the time, being indeede not able to doe as hee would, for the moſt part of his Councell, and thoſe of the chiefeſt were leagers, and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> the head of thoſe monſters, had cauſed ſuch infamous rumours to be rayſed of the Kings actions, and by ſecret practiſes had ſo diſgraced him among his ſubiects, that he was almoſt growne into contempt among the communaltie, and was imputed no bodie in compariſon of the <hi>Guiſe.</hi> This opinion the King would gladly haue rooted out, and was verie deſirous to gaine their good willes and affections, if poſsibly he might. The better to effect this, he thought beſt to proclaime wars afreſh againſt the Proteſtants,<note place="margin">The King prepareth to go into Poictou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Proteſtants.</note> and to rayſe a great power, and to go in perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Poictou,</hi> agaynſt the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and all his confederates, that ſo by ſome famous exploits againſt thoſe of the reformed religion, hee might regaine the loue and liking of his loſt ſubiects.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who knew that he had ſtollen away the peoples hearts from the King, thought it now good time to diſcouer his ſecrete meaning more openly, and preſuming of his fauourers at Court, and the good wil of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,<note place="margin">The Guiſe determineth to ſeiſe vpon Paris, and to take the King.</note> concludeth to get <hi>Paris,</hi> to ſeiſe vpon the king either aliue or dead, to kill as many princes of the blood, and other officers of the crown as he could lay hands vpon, and by fine force to ſet the diadem of <hi>France</hi> vpon his owne head. Now that he might be the more aſſured to accompliſh all this, he wrote ſecret letters to all his chiefe friends and followers, to meete him at <hi>Paris,</hi> as ſpedily as they might. And for that the King ſhould not be able to withſtand him, he had ſet the duke of <hi>Aumaile</hi> to warre againſt ſundry townes and cities in <hi>Picardy,</hi> and had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen order that others ſhould attempt as much in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and other places: knowing that the king would ſend thither his principall forces to keepe thoſe countries in his obedience, and then he might with more facilitie execute his intended purpoſe.</p>

But this handkercheffe was intercepted with the remembrance, as the Page was comming vppe, and neuer came to his handes.</p>
               <p>The Duke in going through a narrow paſſage to the King, encreaſed his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, and was about to returne, but ſtill hee went forwards into the Kings vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter chamber, where ſeeing the Lord <hi>Loiguake</hi> fitting vpon a cheſt, whom of all other he moſt hated, for that he had beene long perſwaded that the ſame Lord determined to kill him, hee ſet his hand to his ſword with a purpoſe to ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſayde <hi>Loiguake:</hi> but by reaſon hee did weare his Cloake Scarft wiſe, he was ſo troubled, that he could not draw it paſt halfe way out of the ſheath: they who were appoynted for his execution,<note place="margin">The death of Francis D. of Guyſe.</note> ſeeing him enterpriſe ſuch an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious act and that at the kings chamber doore, preuented him and ſlew him at that inſtant.</p>

The King ſought all the opportunitie that might be to fight with the Duke, and offered many skirmiſhes to drawe him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but hee knowing fortune to bee very inconſtant, and in the warres e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to bee moſt wauering and vncertayne, vtterly refuſed to hazard all vppon a Battaile, and vnderſtanding that there was ſome ſcarcitie
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2733:75"/> in the kings campe, and that it was impoſsible that ſo great a multitude ſhoulde bee long kept togither in a Countrey ſo exceedingly waſted, where there were no meanes to relieue their wants, kept himſelfe cloſe, and ſought to wearie his enemies by his long delaies.</p>
               <p>The K. daily braued the Spaniards in the face, &amp; dared them by many indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to come to handy ſtrokes: which made the Duke reſolue to do ſomwhat, albeit he were ſickly and moſt vnwilling to fight,<note place="margin">The Duke would not bee drawne to an entire fight.</note> ſuppoſing that if hee ſhoulde not ſtirre vpon ſo many prouocations, his enemies would waxe more couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and himſelfe with all his Spaniards ſhould loſe much of their wonted ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor &amp; reputation. Whereupon he determined to encounter with the kings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to make ſome triall of the courage and reſolution of his enemies: yet ſo warily, that he would be ſure not to bring himſelfe and his ſouldiers to a ſet bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, but by ſome light conflict to maintain his honor: and by a Spaniſh brauado, to make the world beleeue, that hee did but little eſteeme of the king, and all his forces. Whereupon euery thing being in a readineſſe, and hauing encouraged his troupes with ſundry perſwaſions, the ſignall was no ſooner giuen, but there began a ſharpe and cruel fight, which haſtened the death of many braue and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant ſouldiers. But the Duke eſpying the Kings ſide to be too ſtrong, and that his men were put to the worſe, withdrewe his troupes within their intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hauing loſt the yong Lord of <hi>Chaſtres,</hi> and many other of great recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and account. The dukes horſe was ſhot through with a bullet. The Count <hi>Horratio, Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Hanniball Bentiuolio,</hi> with many others were ſore wounded and in daunger of their liues. The Duke not liking to trie the quarell any more by force, fell to his old politike practiſes,<note place="margin">The duke de Maine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth Roan.</note> and laboured by all poſſible meanes to get away away from the king without any further fighting.

The King purſued him, and following him in the taile, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to skirmiſh with him vpon euerie aduauntage. But ſeeing hee coulde not effect that, which hee ſo earneſtly affected, which was to drawe him to an entyre fight: hee cauſed all his troupes to turne heade, and ledde them before <hi>Caudebecke,</hi> which he foorthwith recouered from the Leaguers, and leauing a ſtrong garriſon to defende the Riuer, he retyred to <hi>Deepe,</hi>

Thus did the Kings affaires begin to go backward, and many townes who were wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering before, did nowe wholy abandon the King, and ioyne with the rebels. Sundry of the nobilitie, who were popiſhly affected, and therefore glad of the Kings bad ſucceſſe, reuolted, and ſecretly conueyed themſelues away, either to the enemy, or into their owne countries, and by their bad example, drew on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite numbers to take the ſame courſe, forſaking their lawfull prince when hee ſtood in greateſt need of their ſeruice, expoſing that noble kingdome to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous villanie of that viperous broode, who neuer ceaſe gnawing out of the bowels of her, that ſhould be their deareſt and beſt beloued mother.</p>
               <p>The King wanting ſufficient power to ſtop theſe wicked proceedings, was forced to ſuffer the rebels to range at large, and to get many of his townes, both in <hi>Normandy, Britany, Prouince,</hi> and <hi>Dauphiny:</hi> They took likewiſe <hi>Eſpernon:</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they found great ſtore of wine, corne, &amp; other neceſſaries for the wars.

The king was loath to looſe <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> being a towne of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good importance, and therfore drew all his forces to the ſiege therof, where the Mareſchall <hi>Biron</hi> was ſlaine<note place="margin">Mareſchall Biron ſlaine.</note> with a ſhot from the wall, while hee was verie buſie in viewing the army, &amp; in giuing order for the planting of the ſiege Yea, and the king himſelf was in great perill,<note place="margin">The daunger of the King.</note> hauing his horſe killed vnder him with the ſame bullet, wherewith the Mareſchall was ſlaine before.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2733:76"/> as when they came firſt into <hi>France,</hi> they were deſirous to paſſe rather by leaue then by force, and therefore they thought it conuenient to ſend to the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> for to obtaine Licenſe of him, that they might quietly paſſe through the Dukedom of <hi>Luxemburge,</hi> who readily condiſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded therto, vpon condition that they ſhould not rifle the Countrey as they went, but ſhould trauaile in peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner, and pay for whatſoeuer they tooke.
